## 💬 Questions for Client Feedback

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review each section and provide feedback on the following:

1. **Branding** — Should "APEX OPS" reflect your actual company name/logo?
2. **Data Fields** — Are there additional guard or client fields needed (e.g., NID/Aadhaar, contract value)?
3. **Roles** — Are the 3 roles (Admin, Client, Staff) sufficient, or do you need sub-roles (e.g., Site Supervisor)?
4. **Reports** — Do you need monthly PDF payroll reports, or export to Excel for attendance/billing?
5. **Notifications** — Should the system send email/SMS alerts for missed attendance or invoice due dates?
6. **Mobile** — Is mobile (tablet/phone) access a priority for field guards logging attendance?
7. **Priority Modules** — Which module would you like to prioritise for backend integration first?

*APEX OPS Security & Facility ERP — Confidential Client Preview · August 2026*

## Live production data layer

The production ERP uses FastAPI on Vercel with Supabase/Postgres as the system of record. The dashboard and core master-data modules consume authenticated `/api/v1` endpoints; client-side demo authentication is disabled in production.

> Production database configuration is supplied through Vercel environment variables; no database credentials are stored in the repository.

<!-- Vercel deployment trigger: 2026-09-23 -->
